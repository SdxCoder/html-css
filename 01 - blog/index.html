                I started writing on Medium in 2016 when blogging was my hobby. A few months later, I realized the
                monetary potential of this blogging platform, and it’s proven to be a great start for my writing career.

                <h3>What is Medium?</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Medium is a social publishing platform that is open to all users and home to a diverse array of stories,
                ideas, and perspectives. Anyone can write for the platform, so it's great for beginners.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Popular topics on Medium range from mental health to social media, from world affairs and trending news to
            productivity hacks. This makes it a solid choice for anyone who wants to start blogging.
        </p>
        <img src="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/hubfs/how-to-use-Medium-1-20240723-5974727.webp">

        <p>
            As Medium founder (and Blogger creator/Twitter co-founder) Ev Williams wrote when he launched the platform
            in 2012:
            <em> “Medium is not about who you are or whom you know, but about what you have to say.” </em>
        </p>
        <a id="how-does-medium-work"></a>
        <h2>How does Medium work?</h2>
        <p> "The first thing you'll notice on the Medium website is its site design.</p>
        <p>As former HubSpot Senior Content
            Strategist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikdevaney/"> Erik Devaney </a> says, <em> “It's
                minimalistic,
                featuring lots of white space and limited formatting options.
                Want to change the header typeface to Comic Sans? You can't. Medium won't allow for such atrocities of
                design.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>This decision makes great writing the focus. But that's just one of many nuances of Medium.</p>
        <p>Medium is for
            two types of people — writers and readers — who are focused on online content publishing. When I started my
            career in content writing and strategy, I wasn‘t sure what that meant.</p>
        <p>
            I discovered Medium because I was trying to figure out where to build my writing portfolio. I’d heard Medium
            was a good choice, but the first time I
            signed up, I wasn't sure how to use it.</p>

        <p> If you‘re just getting started on the platform, there’s a fair
            amount to
            learn before you hit publish. Let's get into it. </p>
        <h2>Quality Leads to Discovery</h2>
        <p>
            Many writers go years without sharing their writing publicly. But once you decide to become a writer,
            whether you're finishing a first novel or writing content for brands, you need to find a way to share your
            skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Medium is great for writers who invest time and energy in their work. It rewards in-depth, well-researched,
            and useful articles, not just popularity or brand awareness.
        </p>
        <h2>Platform-Enabled Reader Engagement</h2>

        <p>
            Comments and likes are popular in online media. But when you‘re new to writing, it’s helpful to know exactly
            what people are responding to and why.
        </p>
        <p>
            To meet this need, Medium gives readers a chance to highlight and comment directly within the text of each
            article. This process is like the way professional editors engage with writers.
        </p>

        <h2>Curation and Publications</h2>
        <p>
            Medium has curators who review articles for quality. If a curator chooses your article for wider
            distribution, it gives you a chance to introduce your content to more readers.
        </p>
        <p>
            This might include highlighting your article on the platform, showing your post to readers they think will
            want to read it, or adding it to subscriber emails.
        </p>
        <img src="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/hubfs/how-to-use-Medium-2-20240723-3464477.webp" alt="">

        <p>Most curators are publication editors. Some of the most <a href="">popular publications on Medium in 2023
                include</a>:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Startup.</li>
            <li>Towards Data Science.</li>
            <li>Personal Growth.</li>
            <li>UX Collective.</li>
            <li>The Writing Cooperative.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Medium’s curation and publication models aren’t just great for writers. They also give avid readers and fans
            a chance to support their favorite writers.
        </p>

        <h2>Paid Opportunities</h2>

        <p>
            Medium also gives writers the chance to earn money with their stories. As a member of the Partner Program,
            you can put stories behind a paywall to earn income.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this program, you can increase earnings with repeat readers, engagement signals, and more.
        </p>

        <h2>Writing for Medium</h2>

        <p>
            Anyone who has a Medium account can write for Medium — there's no other vetting process involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get started, simply <a href="">sign up for a free Medium account</a> (or upgrade to a $5/month membership
            for unlimited access), and you're ready to start writing from there.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s important to know that articles must adhere to Medium‘s content guidelines and rules. For instance, as
            a writer I can’t promote controversial or extreme content on my Medium account. I can‘t do third-party
            advertising. And there’s a separate set of policies if I want to write about
            <a href="">cryptocurrencies</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Affiliate marketing links are allowed, but writers must tell their audience that they're including these
            links. For the full list of rules for content, take a look at this post on <a href="">Medium Rules</a>.
